        Cryptography is the art and science of securing information by transforming it into a format that
        unauthorized parties cannot understand

        Key Concept of Cryptography
        1.plaintext: the original, readable message or data
        2.Ciphertext: the scrambled or encrypted version of the plaintext
        3.Encryption: the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using algorithm and a key
        4.Decryption: the process of converting ciphertext back into plain text using a key
        5.key: piece of information used in encryption and decryption


        Types of Cryptography
        1.Symmetric key
        same key is ued for enc and dec
        ex: AES,DES
        fast but key distribution is a challenge

        2.Asymmetric key (public key)
        use a pair of keys public key for enc and private key for dec
        ex: RSA,ECC
